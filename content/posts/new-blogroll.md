# Today I'm going to start my new blogroll
I've decided that I'm going to do it using Hugo, instead of plain HTML.

## Why? Well...
I think it's going to be way better so I don't have to worry about having to build the website from the ground up. I know that I could just make the entire website in plain HTML, with no css or cool formatting involved, just plain text, but then I will not be able to use markdown to format my text, which I love.

## Either way...
